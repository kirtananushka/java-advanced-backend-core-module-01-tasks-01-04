1. **HashMap** (unsafe) consistently throws exceptions across all Java versions, as expected, since it isnâ€™t
   thread-safe.
2. **ConcurrentHashMap** performs well with no exceptions, maintaining consistent data integrity with a final map size
   of 10,000 across all versions.
3. **Collections.synchronizedMap** handles concurrency well without exceptions but shows unexpectedly low final map
   sizes in all Java versions after Java 6. This discrepancy suggests that while `synchronizedMap` prevents concurrent
   modifications, it might not handle high write contention effectively, leading to overwriting or missed entries.

### Conclusion

- **ConcurrentHashMap** is the preferred choice for concurrent access.
- **synchronizedMap** provides thread safety but suffers from performance and data consistency issues.
- **HashMap** is unsuitable for concurrent scenarios.
